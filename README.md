## Code project 1 - write code that validates integer input Here are the conditions that your first coding project must implement:

Your solution must include either a do-while or while iteration.

Before the iteration block: your solution must use a Console.WriteLine() statement to prompt the user for an integer value between 5 and 10.

## Inside the iteration block:

    Your solution must use a Console.ReadLine() statement to obtain input from the user.
    Your solution must ensure that the input is a valid representation of an integer.
    If the integer value isn't between 5 and 10, your code must use a Console.WriteLine() statement to prompt the user for an integer value between 5 and 10.
    Your solution must ensure that the integer value is between 5 and 10 before exiting the iteration.
    Below (after) the iteration code block: your solution must use a Console.WriteLine() statement to inform the user that their input value has been accepted.

## For example, when you run your application, it should reject input values such as "two" and "2", but it should accept an input value of "7".

The example described above, the console output should look similar to the following:

Output

Enter an integer value between 5 and 10
two
Sorry, you entered an invalid number, please try again
2
You entered 2. Please enter a number between 5 and 10.
7
Your input value (7) has been accepted.
